It receives an application for execution and builds a Task Execution Graph from the defined Job Graph. It manages job submission and the job lifecycle then allocates work to Task Managers\nThe **Resource Manager** manages Task Slots and leverages underlying orchestrator, like Kubernetes or Yarn.\nA **Task slot** is the unit of work executed on CPU.\nThe **Task Managers** execute the actual stream processing logic. There are multiple task managers running in a cluster. The number of slots limits the number of tasks a TaskManager can execute. After it has been started, a TaskManager registers its slots to the ResourceManager\n\n![](./images/flink-components.png)\n\nThe **Disparcher** exposes API to submit applications for execution. It hosts the user interface too.\n\nOnly one Job Manager is active at a given point of time, and there may be `n` Task Managers.\n\nThere are different [deployment models](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.11/ops/deployment/): \n\n* Deploy on executing cluster, this is the **session mode**. Use **session** cluster to run multiple jobs: we need a JobManager container. \n* **Per job** mode, spin up a cluster per job submission. More k8s oriented. This provides better resource isolation. \n* **Application mode** creates a cluster per app with the main() function executed on the JobManager. It can include multiple jobs but they run inside the app. It allows for saving the required CPU cycles, but also save the bandwidth required for downloading the dependencies locally.\n\nFlink can run on any common resource manager like Hadoop Yarn, Mesos, or Kubernetes. For development purpose, we can use docker images to deploy a **Session** or **Job cluster**.\n\n### Batch processing\n\nProcess all the data in one job with bounded dataset. It is used when we need all the data for assessing trend, develop AI model, and with a focus on throughput instead of latency.\n\nHadoop was designed to do batch processing. Flink has capability to replace Hadoop map reduce processing.\n\n### High Availability\n\n\nWith Task managers running in parallel, if one fails the number of available slots drops by the JobManager asks the Resource Manager to get new processing slots. The application's restart strategy determines how often the JobManager restarts the application and how long it waits between restarts.\n\nFlink uses Zookeeper to manage multiple JobManagers and select the leader to control the execution of the streaming application. Application's tasks checkpoints and other states are saved in a remote storage, but metadata are saved in Zookeeper. When a JobManager fails, all tasks that belong to its application are automatically cancelled. A new JobManager that takes over the work by getting information of the storage from Zookeeper, and then restarts the process with the JobManager.\n\n\n## Stream processing concepts\n\nIn [Flink](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.12/learn-flink/#stream-processing), applications are composed of streaming dataflows that may be transformed by user-defined operators. These dataflows form directed graphs that start with one or more sources, and end in one or more sinks. The data flows between operations. \nThe figure below, from product documentation, summarizes the simple APIs used to develop a data stream processing flow:\n\n ![1](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.12/fig/program_dataflow.svg)\n \n *src: apache Flink product doc*\n\nStream processing includes a set of functions to transform data, to produce a new output stream. Intermediate steps compute rolling aggregations like min, max, mean, or collect and buffer records in time window to compute metrics on finite set of events. \nTo properly define window operator semantics, we need to determine both how events are assigned to buckets and how often the window produces a result. Flink's streaming model is based on windowing and checkpointing, it uses controlled cyclic dependency graph\n as its execution engine.\n\nThe following figure is showing integration of stream processing runtime with an append log system, like Kafka, with internal local state persistence and continuous checkpoint to remote storage as HA support:\n\n![](./images/flink-rt-processing.png)\n\nAs part of the checkpointing process, Flink saves the 'offset read commit' information of the append log, so in case of a failure, Flink recovers a stateful streaming application by restoring its state from a previous checkpoint and resetting the read position on the append log.\n\nThe evolution of microservice is to become more event-driven, which are stateful streaming applications that ingest event streams and process the events with application-specific business logic. This logic can be done in flow defined in Flink and executed in the clustered runtime.\n\n![](./images/evt-app.png)\n\nA lot of predefined connectors exist to connect to specific source and sink. Transform operators can be chained. Dataflow can consume from Kafka, Kinesis, Queue, and any data sources. A typical high level view of Flink app is presented in figure below:\n\n ![2](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.12/fig/flink-application-sources-sinks.png)\n\n *src: apache Flink product doc*\n\n\nPrograms in Flink are inherently parallel and distributed. During execution, a stream has one or more stream partitions, and each operator has one or more operator subtasks.\n\n ![3](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.12/fig/parallel_dataflow.svg)\n\n *src: apache Flink site*\n\nA Flink application, can be stateful, run in parallel on a distributed cluster. The various parallel instances of a given operator will execute independently, in separate threads, and in general will be running on different machines.\nState is always accessed local, which helps Flink applications achieve high throughput and low-latency. You can choose to keep state on the JVM heap, or if it is too large, saves it in efficiently organized on-disk data structures.\n\n ![4](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.12/fig/local-state.png)\n\nThis is the Job Manager component which parallelizes the job and distributes slices of [the Data Stream](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable/dev/datastream_api.html) flow, you defined, to the Task Managers for execution. Each parallel slice of your job will be executed in a **task slot**.\n\n ![5](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.12/fig/distributed-runtime.svg)\n\nOnce Flink is started (for example with the docker image), Flink Dashboard [http://localhost:8081/#/overview](http://localhost:8081/#/overview) presents the execution reporting of those components:\n\n ![6](./images/flink-dashboard.png)\n\nThe execution is from one of the training examples, the number of task slot was set to 4, and one job is running.\n\nSpark is not a true real time processing while Flink is. Flink and Spark support batch processing too. \n\n## Stateless\n\nSome applications support data loss and expect fast recovery times in case of failure and \nalways consuming the latest incoming data. \nAlerting applications where only low latency alerts are useful, or application where only the last\ndata received is relevant. \n\nWhen checkpointing is turned off Flink offers no inherent guarantees in case of failures. This means that you can\n either have data loss or duplicate messages combined always with a loss of application state.\n\n## Statefulness\n\nWhen using aggregates or windows operators, states need to be kept. For fault tolerant Flink uses checkpoints and savepoints. \nCheckpoints represent a snapshot of where the input data stream is with each operator's state. A streaming dataflow can be resumed from a checkpoint while maintaining consistency (exactly-once processing semantics) by restoring the state of the operators and by replaying the records from the point of the checkpoint.\n\nIn case of failure of a parallel execution, Flink stops the stream flow, then restarts operators from the last checkpoints. When doing the reallocation of data partition for processing, states are reallocated too. \nStates are saved on distributed file systems. When coupled with Kafka as data source, the committed read offset will be part of the checkpoint data.\n\nFlink uses the concept of `Checkpoint Barriers`, which represents a separation of records, so records received since the last snapshot are part of the future snapshot. Barrier can be seen as a mark, a tag in the data stream that close a snapshot. \n\n ![Checkpoints](./images/checkpoints.png)\n\nIn Kafka, it will be the last committed read offset. The barrier flows with the stream so can be distributed. Once a sink operator (the end of a streaming DAG) has received the `barrier n` from all of its input streams, it acknowledges that `snapshot n` to the checkpoint coordinator. \nAfter all sinks have acknowledged a snapshot, it is considered completed. Once `snapshot n` has been completed, the job will never ask the source for records before such snapshot.\n\nState snapshots are save in a state backend (in memory, HDFS, RockDB). \n\nKeyedStream is a key-value store. Key match the key in the stream, state update does not need transaction.\n\nFor DataSet (Batch processing) there is no checkpoint, so in case of failure the stream is replayed.\nWhen addressing exactly once processing it is very important to consider the following:\n\n1. the read from the source\n1. apply the processing logic like window aggregation\n1. generate the results to a sink\n\n1 and 2 can be done exactly once, using Flink source connector and checkpointing but generating one unique result to a sink is more complex and \nis dependant of the target technology. \n\n![](./images/e2e-1.png)\n\nAfter reading records from Kafka, do the processing and generate results, in case of failure\nFlink will reload the record from the read offset and may generate duplicate in the Sink. \n\n![](./images/e2e-2.png)\n\nAs duplicates will occur, we always need to assess idempotent support from downstream applications.\nA lot of distributed key-value storages support consistent result event after retries.\n\nTo support end-to-end exactly one delivery we need to have a sink that supports transaction\nand two-phase commit.\nIn case of failure we need to rollback the output generated. It is important to note \ntransactional output impacts latency.\n\nFlink takes checkpoints periodically, like every 10 seconds, which leads to the minimum latency\nwe can expect at the sink level.\n\n\nFor Kafka Sink connector, as kafka producer, we need to set the `transactionId`, and the delivery type:\n\n```java\nnew KafkaSinkBuilder<String>()\n    .setBootstrapServers(bootstrapURL)\n    .setDeliverGuarantee(DeliveryGuarantee.EXACTLY_ONCE)\n    .setTransactionalIdPrefix(\"store-sol\")\n```\n\nWith transaction ID, a sequence number is sent by the kafka producer API to the broker, and so\nthe partition leader will be able to remove duplicate retries.\n\n![](./images/e2e-3.png)\n\nWhen the checkpointing period is set, we need to also configure `transaction.max.timeout.ms`\nof the Kafka broker and `transaction.timeout.ms` for the producer (sink connector) to a higher\ntimeout than the checkpointing interval plus the max expected Flink downtime. If not the Kafka broker\nwill consider the connection has fail and will remove its state management.\n\n### State management\n\n* All data maintained by a task and used to compute the results of a function belong to the state of the task.\n* While processing the data, the task can read and update its state and compute its result based on its input data and state.\n* State management includes address very large states, and no state is lost in case of failures.\n* Each operator needs to register its state.\n* **Operator State** is scoped to an operator task: all records processed by the same parallel task have access to the same state\n* **Keyed state** is maintained and accessed with respect to a key defined in the records of an operator’s input stream. Flink maintains one state instance per key value and Flink partitions all records with the same key to the operator task that maintains the state for this key. The key-value map is sharded across all parallel tasks:\n\n![](./images/key-state.png)\n\n* Each task maintains its state locally to improve latency. For small state, the state backends will use JVM heap, but for larger state RocksDB is used. A **state backend** takes care of checkpointing the state of a task to a remote and persistent storage.\n* With stateful distributed processing, scaling stateful operators, enforces state repartitioning and assigning to more or fewer parallel tasks. Keys are organized in key-groups, and key groups are assigned to tasks. Operators with operator list state are scaled by redistributing the list entries. Operators with operator union list state are scaled by broadcasting the full list of state entries to each task.\n\nFlink uses **Checkpointing** to periodically store the state of the various stream processing operators on durable storage. \n\n![](./images/checkpoint.png)\n\nWhen recovering from a failure, the stream processing job can resume from the latest checkpoint. \n\n![](./images/recover-checkpoint.png)\n\nCheckpointing is coordinated by the Job Manager, it knows the location of the latest completed checkpoint which will get important later on. This checkpointing and recovery mechanism can provide exactly-once consistency for application state, given that all operators checkpoint and restore all of their states and that all input streams are reset to the position up to which they were consumed when the checkpoint was taken. This will work perfectly with Kafka, but not with sockets or queues where messages are lost once consumed. Therefore exactly-once state consistency can be ensured only if all input streams are from resettable data sources.\n\nDuring the recovery and depending on the sink operators of an application, some result records might be emitted multiple times to downstream systems.\n\n\n### Windowing\n\n[Windows](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.12/dev/stream/operators/windows.html) are buckets within a Stream and can be defined with times, or count of elements.\n\n* **Tumbling** window assign events into nonoverlapping buckets of fixed size. When the window border is passed, all the events are sent to an evaluation function for processing. Count-based tumbling windows define how many events are collected before triggering evaluation. Time based timbling window define time interval of n seconds. Amount of the data vary in a window. `.keyBy(...).window(TumblingProcessingTimeWindows.of(Time.seconds(2)))`\n\n![](./images/tumbling.png)\n\n* **Sliding** window: same but windows can overlap. An event might belong to multiple buckets. So there is a `window sliding time` parameter: `.keyBy(...).window(SlidingProcessingTimeWindows.of(Time.seconds(2), Time.seconds(1)))`\n\n![](./images/sliding.png)\n\n* **Session** window: Starts when the data stream processes records and stop when there is inactivity, so the timer set this threshold: `.keyBy(...).window(ProcessingTimeSessionWindows.withGap(Time.seconds(5)))`. The operator creates one window for each data element received.\n\n![](./images/session.png)\n\n* **Global** window: one window per key and never close. The processing is done with Trigger:\n\n    ```java\n    .keyBy(0)\n\t.window(GlobalWindows.create())\n\t.trigger(CountTrigger.of(5))\n    ```\n\nKeyStream can help to run in parallel, each window will have the same key.\n\nTime is central to the stream processing, and the time is a parameter of the flow / environment and can take different meanings:\n\n* `ProcessingTime` = system time of the machine executing the task: best performance and low latency\n* `EventTime` = the time at the source level, embedded in the record. Deliver consistent and deterministic results regardless of order \n* `IngestionTime` = time when getting into Flink. \n\nSee example [TumblingWindowOnSale.java](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/flink-studies/blob/master/my-flink/src/main/java/jbcodeforce/windows/TumblingWindowOnSale.java) and to test it, do the following:\n\n```shell\n# Start the SaleDataServer that starts a server on socket 9181 and will read the avg.txt file and send each line to the socket\njava -cp target/my-flink-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar jbcodeforce.sale.SaleDataServer\n# inside the job manager container start with \n`flink run -d -c jbcodeforce.windows.TumblingWindowOnSale /home/my-flink/target/my-flink-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.\n# The job creates the data/profitPerMonthWindowed.txt file with accumulated sale and number of record in a 2 seconds tumbling time window\n(June,Bat,Category5,154,6)\n(August,PC,Category5,74,2)\n(July,Television,Category1,50,1)\n(June,Tablet,Category2,142,5)\n(July,Steamer,Category5,123,6)\n...\n```\n\n### Trigger\n\n[Trigger](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.13/dev/stream/operators/windows.html#triggers) determines when a window is ready to be processed. All windows have default trigger. For example tumbling window has a 2s trigger. Global window has explicit trigger. We can implement our own triggers by implementing the Trigger interface with different methods to implement: onElement(..), onEventTime(...), onProcessingTime(...)\n\nDefault triggers:\n\n* EventTimeTrigger: fires based upon progress of event time\n* ProcessingTimeTrigger: fires based upon progress of processing time\n* CountTrigger: fires when # of element in a window > parameter\n* PurgingTrigger\n\n### Eviction\n\nEvictor is used to remove elements from a window after the trigger fires and before or after the window function is applied. The logic to remove is app specific.\n\nThe predefined evictors: CountEvictor, DeltaEvictor and TimeEvictor.\n\n### Watermark\n\n[Watermark](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.13/dev/event_timestamps_watermarks.html) is the mechanism to keep how the event time has progressed: with windowing operator, event time stamp is used, but windows are defined on elapse time, for example, 10 minutes, so watermark helps to track te point of time where no more delayed events will arrive. \nThe Flink API expects a WatermarkStrategy that contains both a TimestampAssigner and WatermarkGenerator. A TimestampAssigner is a simple function that extracts a field from an event. A number of common strategies are available out of the box as static methods on WatermarkStrategy, so reference to the documentation and examples.\n\nWatermark is crucial for out of order events, and when dealing with multi sources. Kafka topic partitions can be a challenge without watermark. With IoT device and network latency, it is possible to get an event with an earlier timestamp, while the operator has already processed such event timestamp from other sources.\n\nIt is possible to configure to accept late events, with the `allowed lateness` time by which element can be late before being dropped. Flink keeps a state of Window until the allowed lateness time expires.\n\n\n## Resources\n\n* [Product documentation](https://flink.apache.org/flink-architecture.html). \n* [Official training](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.12/learn-flink/)\n* Base docker image is: [https://hub.docker.com/_/flink](https://hub.docker.com/_/flink)\n* [Flink docker setup](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master/ops/deployment/docker.html) and the docker-compose files in this repo.\n* [FAQ](https://wints.github.io/flink-web/faq.html)\n* [Cloudera flink stateful tutorial](https://github.com/cloudera/flink-tutorials/tree/master/flink-stateful-tutorial): very good example for inventory transaction and queries on item considered as stream\n* [Building real-time dashboard applications with Apache Flink, Elasticsearch, and Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/blog/building-real-time-dashboard-applications-with-apache-flink-elasticsearch-and-kibana)\n* Udemy Apache Flink a real time hands-on.

A typical high level view of Flink app is presented in figure below:\n\n ![2](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.12/fig/flink-application-sources-sinks.png)\n\n *src: apache Flink product doc*\n\n\nPrograms in Flink are inherently parallel and distributed. During execution, a stream has one or more stream partitions, and each operator has one or more operator subtasks.\n\n ![3](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.12/fig/parallel_dataflow.svg)\n\n *src: apache Flink site*\n\nA Flink application, can be stateful, run in parallel on a distributed cluster. The various parallel instances of a given operator will execute independently, in separate threads, and in general will be running on different machines.\nState is always accessed local, which helps Flink applications achieve high throughput and low-latency. You can choose to keep state on the JVM heap, or if it is too large, saves it in efficiently organized on-disk data structures.\n\n ![4](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.12/fig/local-state.png)\n\nThis is the Job Manager component which parallelizes the job and distributes slices of [the Data Stream](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-stable/dev/datastream_api.html) flow, you defined, to the Task Managers for execution. Each parallel slice of your job will be executed in a **task slot**.\n\n ![5](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.12/fig/distributed-runtime.svg)\n\nOnce Flink is started (for example with the docker image), Flink Dashboard [http://localhost:8081/#/overview](http://localhost:8081/#/overview) presents the execution reporting of those components:\n\n ![6](./images/flink-dashboard.png)\n\nThe execution is from one of the training examples, the number of task slot was set to 4, and one job is running.\n\nSpark is not a true real time processing while Flink is. Flink and Spark support batch processing too. \n\n## Stateless\n\nSome applications support data loss and expect fast recovery times in case of failure and \nalways consuming the latest incoming data. \nAlerting applications where only low latency alerts are useful, or application where only the last\ndata received is relevant. \n\nWhen checkpointing is turned off Flink offers no inherent guarantees in case of failures. This means that you can\n either have data loss or duplicate messages combined always with a loss of application state.\n\n## Statefulness\n\nWhen using aggregates or windows operators, states need to be kept. For fault tolerant Flink uses checkpoints and savepoints. \nCheckpoints represent a snapshot of where the input data stream is with each operator's state. A streaming dataflow can be resumed from a checkpoint while maintaining consistency (exactly-once processing semantics) by restoring the state of the operators and by replaying the records from the point of the checkpoint.\n\nIn case of failure of a parallel execution, Flink stops the stream flow, then restarts operators from the last checkpoints. When doing the reallocation of data partition for processing, states are reallocated too. \nStates are saved on distributed file systems. When coupled with Kafka as data source, the committed read offset will be part of the checkpoint data.\n\nFlink uses the concept of `Checkpoint Barriers`, which represents a separation of records, so records received since the last snapshot are part of the future snapshot. Barrier can be seen as a mark, a tag in the data stream that close a snapshot. \n\n ![Checkpoints](./images/checkpoints.png)\n\nIn Kafka, it will be the last committed read offset. The barrier flows with the stream so can be distributed. Once a sink operator (the end of a streaming DAG) has received the `barrier n` from all of its input streams, it acknowledges that `snapshot n` to the checkpoint coordinator. \nAfter all sinks have acknowledged a snapshot, it is considered completed. Once `snapshot n` has been completed, the job will never ask the source for records before such snapshot.\n\nState snapshots are save in a state backend (in memory, HDFS, RockDB). \n\nKeyedStream is a key-value store. Key match the key in the stream, state update does not need transaction.\n\nFor DataSet (Batch processing) there is no checkpoint, so in case of failure the stream is replayed.\nWhen addressing exactly once processing it is very important to consider the following:\n\n1. the read from the source\n1. apply the processing logic like window aggregation\n1. generate the results to a sink\n\n1 and 2 can be done exactly once, using Flink source connector and checkpointing but generating one unique result to a sink is more complex and \nis dependant of the target technology. \n\n![](./images/e2e-1.png)\n\nAfter reading records from Kafka, do the processing and generate results, in case of failure\nFlink will reload the record from the read offset and may generate duplicate in the Sink. \n\n![](./images/e2e-2.png)\n\nAs duplicates will occur, we always need to assess idempotent support from downstream applications.\nA lot of distributed key-value storages support consistent result event after retries.\n\nTo support end-to-end exactly one delivery we need to have a sink that supports transaction\nand two-phase commit.\nIn case of failure we need to rollback the output generated. It is important to note \ntransactional output impacts latency.\n\nFlink takes checkpoints periodically, like every 10 seconds, which leads to the minimum latency\nwe can expect at the sink level.\n\n\nFor Kafka Sink connector, as kafka producer, we need to set the `transactionId`, and the delivery type:\n\n```java\nnew KafkaSinkBuilder<String>()\n    .setBootstrapServers(bootstrapURL)\n    .setDeliverGuarantee(DeliveryGuarantee.EXACTLY_ONCE)\n    .setTransactionalIdPrefix(\"store-sol\")\n```\n\nWith transaction ID, a sequence number is sent by the kafka producer API to the broker, and so\nthe partition leader will be able to remove duplicate retries.\n\n![](./images/e2e-3.png)\n\nWhen the checkpointing period is set, we need to also configure `transaction.max.timeout.ms`\nof the Kafka broker and `transaction.timeout.ms` for the producer (sink connector) to a higher\ntimeout than the checkpointing interval plus the max expected Flink downtime. If not the Kafka broker\nwill consider the connection has fail and will remove its state management.\n\n### State management\n\n* All data maintained by a task and used to compute the results of a function belong to the state of the task.\n* While processing the data, the task can read and update its state and compute its result based on its input data and state.\n* State management includes address very large states, and no state is lost in case of failures.\n* Each operator needs to register its state.\n* **Operator State** is scoped to an operator task: all records processed by the same parallel task have access to the same state\n* **Keyed state** is maintained and accessed with respect to a key defined in the records of an operator’s input stream. Flink maintains one state instance per key value and Flink partitions all records with the same key to the operator task that maintains the state for this key. The key-value map is sharded across all parallel tasks:\n\n![](./images/key-state.png)\n\n* Each task maintains its state locally to improve latency. For small state, the state backends will use JVM heap, but for larger state RocksDB is used. A **state backend** takes care of checkpointing the state of a task to a remote and persistent storage.\n* With stateful distributed processing, scaling stateful operators, enforces state repartitioning and assigning to more or fewer parallel tasks. Keys are organized in key-groups, and key groups are assigned to tasks. Operators with operator list state are scaled by redistributing the list entries. Operators with operator union list state are scaled by broadcasting the full list of state entries to each task.\n\nFlink uses **Checkpointing** to periodically store the state of the various stream processing operators on durable storage. \n\n![](./images/checkpoint.png)\n\nWhen recovering from a failure, the stream processing job can resume from the latest checkpoint. \n\n![](./images/recover-checkpoint.png)\n\nCheckpointing is coordinated by the Job Manager, it knows the location of the latest completed checkpoint which will get important later on. This checkpointing and recovery mechanism can provide exactly-once consistency for application state, given that all operators checkpoint and restore all of their states and that all input streams are reset to the position up to which they were consumed when the checkpoint was taken. This will work perfectly with Kafka, but not with sockets or queues where messages are lost once consumed. Therefore exactly-once state consistency can be ensured only if all input streams are from resettable data sources.\n\nDuring the recovery and depending on the sink operators of an application, some result records might be emitted multiple times to downstream systems.\n\n\n### Windowing\n\n[Windows](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.12/dev/stream/operators/windows.html) are buckets within a Stream and can be defined with times, or count of elements.\n\n* **Tumbling** window assign events into nonoverlapping buckets of fixed size. When the window border is passed, all the events are sent to an evaluation function for processing. Count-based tumbling windows define how many events are collected before triggering evaluation. Time based timbling window define time interval of n seconds. Amount of the data vary in a window. `.keyBy(...).window(TumblingProcessingTimeWindows.of(Time.seconds(2)))`\n\n![](./images/tumbling.png)\n\n* **Sliding** window: same but windows can overlap. An event might belong to multiple buckets. So there is a `window sliding time` parameter: `.keyBy(...).window(SlidingProcessingTimeWindows.of(Time.seconds(2), Time.seconds(1)))`\n\n![](./images/sliding.png)\n\n* **Session** window: Starts when the data stream processes records and stop when there is inactivity, so the timer set this threshold: `.keyBy(...).window(ProcessingTimeSessionWindows.withGap(Time.seconds(5)))`. The operator creates one window for each data element received.\n\n![](./images/session.png)\n\n* **Global** window: one window per key and never close. The processing is done with Trigger:\n\n    ```java\n    .keyBy(0)\n\t.window(GlobalWindows.create())\n\t.trigger(CountTrigger.of(5))\n    ```\n\nKeyStream can help to run in parallel, each window will have the same key.\n\nTime is central to the stream processing, and the time is a parameter of the flow / environment and can take different meanings:\n\n* `ProcessingTime` = system time of the machine executing the task: best performance and low latency\n* `EventTime` = the time at the source level, embedded in the record. Deliver consistent and deterministic results regardless of order \n* `IngestionTime` = time when getting into Flink. \n\nSee example [TumblingWindowOnSale.java](https://github.com/jbcodeforce/flink-studies/blob/master/my-flink/src/main/java/jbcodeforce/windows/TumblingWindowOnSale.java) and to test it, do the following:\n\n```shell\n# Start the SaleDataServer that starts a server on socket 9181 and will read the avg.txt file and send each line to the socket\njava -cp target/my-flink-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar jbcodeforce.sale.SaleDataServer\n# inside the job manager container start with \n`flink run -d -c jbcodeforce.windows.TumblingWindowOnSale /home/my-flink/target/my-flink-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.\n# The job creates the data/profitPerMonthWindowed.txt file with accumulated sale and number of record in a 2 seconds tumbling time window\n(June,Bat,Category5,154,6)\n(August,PC,Category5,74,2)\n(July,Television,Category1,50,1)\n(June,Tablet,Category2,142,5)\n(July,Steamer,Category5,123,6)\n...\n```\n\n### Trigger\n\n[Trigger](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.13/dev/stream/operators/windows.html#triggers) determines when a window is ready to be processed. All windows have default trigger. For example tumbling window has a 2s trigger. Global window has explicit trigger. We can implement our own triggers by implementing the Trigger interface with different methods to implement: onElement(..), onEventTime(...), onProcessingTime(...)\n\nDefault triggers:\n\n* EventTimeTrigger: fires based upon progress of event time\n* ProcessingTimeTrigger: fires based upon progress of processing time\n* CountTrigger: fires when # of element in a window > parameter\n* PurgingTrigger\n\n### Eviction\n\nEvictor is used to remove elements from a window after the trigger fires and before or after the window function is applied. The logic to remove is app specific.\n\nThe predefined evictors: CountEvictor, DeltaEvictor and TimeEvictor.\n\n### Watermark\n\n[Watermark](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.13/dev/event_timestamps_watermarks.html) is the mechanism to keep how the event time has progressed: with windowing operator, event time stamp is used, but windows are defined on elapse time, for example, 10 minutes, so watermark helps to track te point of time where no more delayed events will arrive. \nThe Flink API expects a WatermarkStrategy that contains both a TimestampAssigner and WatermarkGenerator. A TimestampAssigner is a simple function that extracts a field from an event. A number of common strategies are available out of the box as static methods on WatermarkStrategy, so reference to the documentation and examples.\n\nWatermark is crucial for out of order events, and when dealing with multi sources. Kafka topic partitions can be a challenge without watermark. With IoT device and network latency, it is possible to get an event with an earlier timestamp, while the operator has already processed such event timestamp from other sources.\n\nIt is possible to configure to accept late events, with the `allowed lateness` time by which element can be late before being dropped. Flink keeps a state of Window until the allowed lateness time expires.\n\n\n## Resources\n\n* [Product documentation](https://flink.apache.org/flink-architecture.html). \n* [Official training](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.12/learn-flink/)\n* Base docker image is: [https://hub.docker.com/_/flink](https://hub.docker.com/_/flink)\n* [Flink docker setup](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-master/ops/deployment/docker.html) and the docker-compose files in this repo.\n* [FAQ](https://wints.github.io/flink-web/faq.html)\n* [Cloudera flink stateful tutorial](https://github.com/cloudera/flink-tutorials/tree/master/flink-stateful-tutorial): very good example for inventory transaction and queries on item considered as stream\n* [Building real-time dashboard applications with Apache Flink, Elasticsearch, and Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/blog/building-real-time-dashboard-applications-with-apache-flink-elasticsearch-and-kibana)\n* Udemy Apache Flink a real time hands-on.
